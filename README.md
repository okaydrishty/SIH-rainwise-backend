Boond â€“ Smart Rainwater Harvesting Backend

Boond is a backend application designed to promote sustainable water management. It helps communities assess rooftop rainwater harvesting potential by calculating costs, suggesting suitable harvesting methods, and managing secure user access.

The system leverages PostgreSQL for data persistence, JWT-based authentication for secure access, and AI agents to intelligently recommend harvesting types and perform cost analysis.

ðŸš€Features

User Authentication

Secure login & signup using JWT tokens.

Role-based access (admin, citizen, contractor, government).

Rainwater Harvesting Type Classifier (AI Agent)

Determines the most suitable type of rainwater harvesting system (e.g., recharge pits, storage tanks, trenches).

Cost Analysis Agent

Estimates setup costs based on roof area, rainfall data, and harvesting method.

Database Integration

PostgreSQL used for storing user details, rainfall data, system recommendations, and cost records.

API Endpoints

RESTful APIs for user management, AI agent queries, and cost calculations.
